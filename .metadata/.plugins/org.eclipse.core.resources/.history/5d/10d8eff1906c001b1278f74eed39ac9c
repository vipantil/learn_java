		//1. unary operators, the operator can take only one operant , Ex: n++
		//2. binary operators, the operator can take two operant , Ex: x + y ( plus is an operator )
		//3. ternary operators, the operator can take three operant
		// arithmetic operators ( + - X / % )
		
		
		// airthmetic operator
		// when one int divided by anoter int the answer will be int
		// when double divide with an int the answer will be double
		// when floating point valve divided with an int the result will be floating point valbe
		System.out.println(10/3);//int value
		System.out.println(10/3.0);//double type value, 16 digit after point
		System.out.println(10.0f/3);//floating point value, 7 digit after point
		System.out.println(3/10);// the answer will be zero ( int divide with int )
		System.out.println(10%3);// will show the reminder 
		System.out.println(-10%3);// -3
		System.out.println(10%-3);// 3
